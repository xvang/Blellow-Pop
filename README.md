# Blellow Pop

It's a game where you pop the bubbles. Pop with one finger, or all the fingers. That's about it.
There are no levels, in-game items, upgrades, or anything. Just you and bubbles. Or "balloons" if you don't like bubbles.




You need 2 things to run the game:
Android Studio
LibGDX





The source code is in the "Core" folder. 
The assets(pictures, audio, etc) are in the android/assets folder.
