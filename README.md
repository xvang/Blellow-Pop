# BCTN-Tower-Defense


So this is a tower defense game. I made it in Android Studio with the LibGDX framework.  

You need 3 things to run the game:
Android Studio
LibGDX
Universal Tween Engine.





The source code is in the "Core" folder. 
The assets(pictures, audio, etc) are in the android/assets folder.
